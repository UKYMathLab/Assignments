Rough sketch of future work

STEP 1
1. Dictionary of (time, students) pairs for each lab group
2. Find product of all such lab group dictionaries, and ask is everyone in this tuple?
3. Get rid of tuples that dont contain everyone

Returns dictionary of (times, partitions) pairs


STEP 2
1. Stable Marriage on partitions for each time
2. (Hopefully) implement variable group size for Stable Marriage algorithm
3. Run results though happiness function to determine which is best
